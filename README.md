The purpose of this study was to determine whether developing a convolutional neural
network (CNN) model trained to identify melanoma and benign skin cancer will be effective in
aiding with the diagnosis of skin cancers. This was tested by using three different CNNs applied
to a separate, unlabeled dataset consisting of images of benign and melanoma cancer lesions. The
number of convolutional filters was adjusted for each model so that there were a few, moderate,
or large number of filters, producing accuracies of 68.421%, 89.474%, and 57.897%
respectively. A one-way ANOVA statistical analysis was run on the prediction accuracies, and a
F-statistic value of 65535, which was more extreme than the F-critical value of 5.143, was
obtained, showing that the data was statistically significant. Following the one-way ANOVA, a
post-hoc Tukey test was run with an alpha value of .05, and it was determined that there were
significant differences between all three groups as the differences in the averages all exceeded
the Dmin value. The statistically significant results supported the research hypothesis, which
stated that the CNN with a moderate number of filters would produce the highest accuracy.
Applying the principles of this experiment to the medical field shows that the use of CNNs in
creating an automated medical system could prove to be very beneficial in improving the
accessibility, cost, and invasiveness of the diagnosis of skin cancer
